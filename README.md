# viola_jones_face_detection
Python 2 implementation of real time face detection based on Viola Jones algorithm

The implementation in this repository are based on the works of:

Wang: An Analysis of the Viola-Jones Face Detection Algorithm, 2014
Viola and Jones: Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features 

The face images used for training were dowloaded from The Olivetti Research Laboratory face database.
